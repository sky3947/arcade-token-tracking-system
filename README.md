# ArcadeTokenTrackingSystem

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.2. This is an assignment.

## Angular setup

If you don't have an Angular development environment set up, follow the local setup steps in the official Angular website [here](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).

## Development server

Go to the project folder in a terminal. Run `ng serve` in the project folder for a dev server. (You may have to run `npm install` to install package dependencies.) Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the Application.

## Future features

Some additional features that would be useful to implement next for a token tracking system:

- A user authentication service for each customer. Every customer gets their own account.
- A payment service to accept money from customers.
- The ability to set a daily token limit. Parents can restrict the number of tokens their children can buy.
